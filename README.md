## Computer Architechture (NYCU lecture)
#### lab1: given the corresponding C code, write the corresponding assembly code of MIPS architecture.
#### lab2: implement an 32-bit ALU and a shifter by Verilog.
#### lab3: implement a simple single cycle CPU with memory unit, which can run R-type, I-type and jump instructions.
#### lab4: modify the single cycle processor designed in previous lab to a pipelined processor.
